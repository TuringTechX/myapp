## **Project Structure**

Genesis is organized into multiple feature modules, each focusing on a specific global challenge or functionality. Below is the high-level structure of the project:

```
Aeonexus/
│
├── lib/
│   ├── components/         # Reusable UI components
│   ├── models/             # Data models for app state
│   ├── services/           # Business logic and API integrations
│   ├── screens/            # Different screens for each app module
│   ├── utils/              # Utility functions and constants
│   └── Aeonexus.dart       # Main entry point
│
├── assets/                 # Images, fonts, and other assets
├── firebase/               # Firebase-related files
├── test/                   # Unit and integration tests
└── pubspec.yaml            # Dependency management
```

### Key Directories:

- **components/**: Contains the UI components such as buttons, cards, and custom widgets.
